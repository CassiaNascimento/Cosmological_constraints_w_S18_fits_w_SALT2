# Cosmological_constraints_w_S18_fits_w_SALT2

Here we analyse the Cosmology for \Lambda CDM and Flat \omega CDM universes using the Pantheon fits from Scolnic et al. 2018. We compare the MCMC results using EMCEE package for 4 different model versions. Using the complete likelihood description we fit SALT2 with and without bias corrections. We also fit two different approaches, one including a new gamma parameter which appears in SALT2 distance modulus as proportional to the product of c and x_1. The last model includes in the distance modulus higher powers of c and x_1, now proportional to two new nuisance parameters. These approaches were implemented with the intention of recovering lost information when applying Tripp's formula.
